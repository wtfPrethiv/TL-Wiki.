It is available both as a downloadable application built on the Electron framework and as a browser-based version, vscode.dev, for editing local and remote files. Key features include syntax highlighting, bracket matching, code folding, configurable snippets, IntelliSense for languages like JavaScript and HTML, and built-in debugging support for Node.js, extendable for other languages via marketplace extensions. The debugger allows developers to attach to processes, step through code, set breakpoints, monitor variables, and use an integrated Debug Console for real-time expression evaluation.\\n\\nInstead of a project system, VS Code manages development through opening directories as workspaces, making it language-agnostic. Many functionalities are accessible via the keyboard-driven Command Palette, complementing its user interface. It also provides a fully featured integrated terminal supporting various shells, with enhancements like clickable file links and error detection to aid navigation and debugging.\\n\\nThe editor is highly extensible through its Marketplace, offering extensions for language support, themes, debuggers, and other utilities. It includes built-in source control integration, allowing users to manage systems like Git directly for tasks such as viewing changes and handling repositories. VS Code also supports remote development via extensions like Remote-SSH and Remote-Containers, and its web version facilitates browser-based access. Microsoft collects usage data to improve the product, a telemetry feature that can be disabled. An \\\"Insiders\\\" version provides nightly builds for early access to new features, operating independently of the stable release.\"\n",
